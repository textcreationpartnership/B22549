            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>A SVRVEY OF THE ARTICLES OF THE LATE REIECTED PEACE CONCLVDED In the Marques of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Cabinet in <hi>Dublin,</hi> the 29. of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1646, and there published, as if the same were concluded the 28. of March before. In which survey it is proved by notable obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon some of the said articles, that the said Peace is destructive of the Catholique Faith, disadvantagious to His Majesty, pernicious to his Catholique sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and favourable onely to rebellious Parliamentary Heretiques.</p>
            <p>Vnto the iniquitie of which Peace is added the invaliditie and nullitie thereof: 1. By the revocation of the Marques of <hi>Ormonds</hi> Commission before any Peace was legally concluded &amp;c. <hi>2.</hi> By the defect of sufficient Commission or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie on the part of our Committee of the Treaty. <hi>3.</hi> By the revocation thereof by the Protestation of the principall part of the Body Politique of the Kingdome and other Inhibitions. <hi>4.</hi> By exceeding their Commission. <hi>5.</hi> By deviating from the rules established by assembly, by which they ought to regular themselves, namely, from the Oath of Association, Modell of government, Acts of Assembly, Grievances, Declarations, and Propositions made by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to His Majestie, &amp;c. <hi>6.</hi> By rejecting the Kings favours and graces. <hi>7.</hi> By their surreptitious and clancular concluding of a Peace contrary to their promise made unto the Lord Nuncius. <hi>8.</hi> By the Kingdoms non-acceptance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;</p>
            <p>Whence the Iustice of the Clergies Decree of Perjurie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication against the Adherents to so impious and invalid a Peace, is evidently deduced.</p>

            <p>I am forced (Right Reverend Lords, and Venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) to dispatch this first part of my Survey of the Articles of the late rejected Peace, which proves the iniquitie and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice thereof, and to expose the same to publique view be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before the second part, which proves the invaliditie of the same peace; because, I heare,

               <hi>Inimicus homo superseminavit ziza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, &amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Enemie man hath sow'd the tares of</hi> division among our Armies neere <hi>Dublin,</hi> and made use of some of our own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, as active Instruments to promove his designe: <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam saperent &amp; intelligerent, &amp; novissima providerent.</hi> The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of <hi>Ormond</hi> appeares not in the businesse: The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> hath assumed his Excellencie the Marques of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> to act this tragicke scene: he without authoritie promiseth much, but alas is able (in the condition of these times) to performe little; without Commission undertaketh all things; yet while he hath no other prop, than <hi>Digbyes</hi> parolle, he is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme nothing.</p>
            <p>His Excellency the Marques of <hi>Clanrickard</hi> might reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb facs="tcp:154413:6"/>suppose, that the Nuncius, the Clergie and Confederate Catholiques of Ireland have more power, and can prevaile more with the Popes Holynesse, our Queene, and the State of France, than any one particular Subject in England or Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. By his engagement nought else is to be expected, but a fatall division betweene the Confederate Catholiques of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to the destruction of Religion, prejudice of His Majestie; and ruine of this distressed Nation, which the God of mercie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert. The politicke dayes of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are revived in these our woefull dayes, and Catholiques are assumed as instruments to raise up heresie and pull downe Religion. Was it to that end his Holynesse spent his moneyes to rescue Connaught from the Scots?</p>
            <p>Our Nobilitie, and centry of the Pale were not intrusted by those of <hi>Dublin</hi> with armes to defend themselves, and in the progresse of these warres they have been pillaged, burned, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed and banished, above all others of this Nation, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they in time past assisted by a sociall warre to settle His Maiesty in a full and secure possession of Vlster. Being forgetfull of this foule remuneration they would now precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate themselves into an unwarrantable and unsafe Peace with those very persons, that thus afflicted them. <hi>Venatione cepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt me quasi avem inimici mei gratis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Thren.</hi> 3.52</note> I beseech them (for their owne good, and the good of their posteritie) that they would consult with disinteressed Lawyers, who may truly enforme them, whither by the Articles of the Peace rejected, or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement of the Marques of <hi>Clanrickard,</hi> they are any way se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured of their Religion, Lives or Estates. The indictements &amp; attainders of their persons, and the offices taken on their land remaine still in full force: the act of oblivion will not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till the next Parliament: how many of their heads may be chop'd off before then? They are indeed call'd backe to their lands, but there to live, as Tenants at will, seeing no solid as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance is given them to possesse the same without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whensoever it shall please the present Lord Lieutenant or his successors, they may be ejected, and forced to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the maine-Rates during the time they possessed the same by intrusion, and withall they themselves may be arraig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb facs="tcp:154413:6"/>for their lives. Let them turne themselves what way they list, they are like to be a prey on all sides, if they adhere not (according to their oath) to the Catholique Confederacie. They ought not for any injurie pretended to be done them by any their fellow-Confederates, concurre to any act destructive to themselves, and their Religion. Redresse may be had by more lawfull wayes, and a Course layd downe for prevention of any future injurie. <hi>Vae illi, per quem venit scandalum.</hi>

            <p>How shall wee avoid Gods just indignation, the infamous note of perjurie, and everlasting disgrace among all Nations, if (having proclaimed unto the world, and accordingly taken a solemne oath) that wee would maintaine the Catholique Religion) wee should reject all the graces granted unto us by our Soveraigne for the maintenance of the same Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and adhere unto his Subject and unto a Peace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to all the said graces? His Majestie grants us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale of the penall lawes made against Religion: the subject denyes it. His Majestie commands the suspension of <hi>Poynings</hi> act, which might otherwise be a hindrance unto us and unto the Catholique Religion the next Parliament: the subject sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it: His Majestie grants unto us a Catholique Vice-Roy to governe us; a thing knowne abroad in Catholique Countreyes, and by all Catholiques passionatly desired; the Subject invents wayes, to reject it. Shall wee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the King or to the Subject; to our Religion or to heresie; to the Conventicle of Malignants, or to our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Confederacy; to our solemne oath and publique prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, or to perjurie and perfidie? <hi>Perditio tua ex te Israel.</hi> These human policies have hitherto produced no other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, than the distracting of the subjects from assisting their Soveraigne, and are like for the future to produce no better. When great ones preferre their owne private interest before the Kings securitie, what hopes are there of any reliefe to be sent him? If ever the Catholique Confederats send over succour for His Majestie, (as by their protestation they have vowed) they resolve never to give the honour of their labours and charge in that expedition to any Protestant subject breathing; for that were to fall into the old servitude; when the Catholiques con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
<pb facs="tcp:154413:7"/>well nigh a million of money to His Majestie, the Protestant or Puritan Ministers of Iustice assumed all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of such Contributions to themselves, and represented the Catholiques as Refractories.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Neither ought any man be deluded by those words, which are added in the <hi>Proviso (according to the forme now used in the Protestant Church in Ireland)</hi> for it is knowne, most of the formes used in that new Church (chiefely in matter of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) is derived from the Catholique Church, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant-Church doth in that particularly Apishly imitate: so as if a Catholique Church-man desire to be promoved to any benefice, though it be according the forme of the Catholique Church, yet the Protestant Governors in this kingdome, will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154413:10"/>say, that such promotion is according the forme of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church, (because both are the same) and therefore compell the Catholique to take the Oath, or never promove him to any benefice. Moreover its knowne that our Kings of <hi>England</hi> have (in many cases) the presentation and nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fit persons to certaine dignities, &amp;c. who might present a Catholique Priest, aswell as a Protestant Minister to such dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, if this cursed <hi>Proviso</hi> were not thrust in into this Article: and a Catholique Priest might still remaine a Catholique, and yet be promoved, presented and nominated by his Prince (though a Protestant) to any such dignities; examples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are frequent in <hi>Germany.</hi> This was foreseene by the Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects of this Article, who therefore couched the same so enig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Now least this one <hi>Proviso</hi> should not be sufficient to hinder <hi>the groth of Popery</hi> (as they speake in the deformed Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers language) this other is added: <hi>If any being Protestant; being advanced, promoted or presented to any Ecclesiasticall benefice, dignitie or promotion, shall afterward become a Roman Catholique, that the exemption aforesaid shall not so farre extend to any such Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholique, but that upon tender of the said oath, and refufall thereof, he be for that cause left subiect to the deprivation of the said benefice.

<note place="margin">The fraud of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch discovered</note> 1644. and no <hi>concession</hi> granted by the Marques in his Majesties behalfe; wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men have fouly erred, taking this for a grant, grace or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour conferred by His Majestie upon the Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, which is indeed no other, than their demand or <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> unto His Majestie. The occasion of this Error was the wilfull obscuritie used by the Contrivers of this Peace, in couching our <hi>Proposition</hi> so cunningly, without parenthesis or distinction of Characters, as the unwary Reader might take that for His Majesties <hi>Concession,</hi> which is but our owne <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> and thinke himselfe to be exempted from the <hi>Penall Lawes,</hi> and to bee allowed <hi>freedome of Religion;</hi> whereas in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deed there is no such matter; the <hi>Penall Lawes</hi> lye alwayes

               <p n="7">7. Before the effusion of so much blood by Heretiques, the exile of so many noble Catholiques, the devastation of so many Cities, Townes &amp; Counties, the depredation of so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of the Kings subjects, we received a far better answer from His Majestie himselfe, even upon this first proposition, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the answers to our <hi>Propositions</hi> printed at <hi>VVaterford</hi> in the yeare 1644. yea before our Agents left <hi>England,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154413:12"/>far better satisfaction from His Majestie himselfe and had there made a happy Conclusion, had not the private letters of Statists (who are now like to sincke in their owne presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) given impediment thereunto. Time run out, and His Majesties affaires begun to decline in <hi>England,</hi> which moved him to looke for succours from his Catholique subjects in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whose religion taught them to preserve faith to God, and loyaltie to their Soveraigne. Wherefore by his letter dated 27. February, 1644. he <hi>commanded</hi> the Marques of <hi>Ormond, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace with the Irish, whatsoever it cost, &amp;c. And if the suspension of Poynings Act for such Bills, as shall be agreed upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you there</hi> (saith His Majestie) <hi>and the present taking away of the penall Lawes against the Papists by a law, will doe it, I shall not thinke it a hard bargaine, &amp;c.</hi> This letter comming to the Marques of <hi>Ormonds</hi> hands was suppressed from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Confederate Catholiques; by which human poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie all succours from <hi>Ireland</hi> to His Majestie into <hi>England</hi> were hindred, which was no small occasion of his Majesties present deplorable condition.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the interim, His Majestie observing, that His letters and Commands were sleighted, and our succours in his pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing necessitie thereby retarded; was pleased to give a speciall Commission to <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> dated at <hi>Oxford</hi> the 12. of <hi>March,</hi> 1644. authorizing him to <hi>treate and conclude with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Catholiques of Ireland,</hi>

<note place="margin">Ormonds Concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> wherein was contained a briefe of such graces and Concessions, as he (in His Majesties Name) was pleased to grant unto the Catholiques. In the very first branch whereof, not a <hi>repeale of the penall Lawes,</hi> as His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie commanded, but an <hi>exemption from penalties, and incapacities
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:154413:12"/>by reason of the exercise of our Religion,</hi> namely, <hi>for saying or hearing Masse, for hearing or making Confession, for giving or receiving absolution; for keeping a Priest; for Preaching of the VVord of God; or administring the Sacraments.</hi> Item that the <hi>High Commission Court, and abuses of excommunication in the Article, &amp;c. should be taken away; that the Catholiques may suy their Liveris and Ouster les mains, upon taking the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance</hi> onely.

To tell us, they relyed on <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Articles, is frivolous, as you shall heare in the third paragraphe. Wee could wish they did indeed rely constantly &amp; resolutely, thereupon then should we little neede such frequent, tedious, and chargeable recourse to <hi>Dublin,</hi> to make a new Peace with them, who had lesse power, than <hi>Glamorgan.</hi> If they laboured so much to preserve Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, King, and Countrey, as they laboured to preserve them, whose courses they saw, were directed, to destroy Religion, King, and Countrey, they should, and lawfully might, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Glamorgans</hi> commission proceed against them with as much violence and hostilitie, as ever they proceeded against <hi>Scot</hi> or Parliament.</p>
               <p n="9">9. On the 25. of <hi>August,</hi> 1645. the Peace was concluded with <hi>Clamorgan;</hi> the conditions thereof were upon oath to be be kept secret, least the publication should prove prejudiciall to His Majestie, who had no lesse cause to feare his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some friends at home and in <hi>Dublin,</hi> than hee had to feare the Parliament and the <hi>Scot.</hi> The Seale of secrecie being broken,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:154413:13"/>and all things revealed to the Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> by some (as is suspected) of our owne Councell or Committes (though it be father'd on others) hee, who of all others should keepe such matters secret, published the same to the whole world. The Marques, Lord <hi>Digbie</hi> and others joyne their heads together:
<note place="margin">

                  <hi>eius.</hi> The Marques solemnely invites <hi>Glamorgan</hi> to keepe Christmas in <hi>Dublin. (seorsim adduxit Abnerem Ioab ad medium portae, ut loqueretur ei in dolo.)</hi> Where hee is intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with close imprisonment in the Castle. The Emulous of Corrivals and enemies of religion sollicite the noble Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique to quit or surrender what power and Commission they then understood, hee had from the King. He (knowing what other more ample power hee had, which came not unto their knowledge, and fearing to come unto the Parliament-clawes) surrenders that power or commission, they knew he had; yet had not that surrender procured his libertie, were it not that the Catholique Confederats resolved to purchase it by their armes and blood.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The emulous are ever suspicious, and the ambitious never secure. They observed <hi>Glamorgan</hi> after his release to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute his Commission with the Confederats, and preparations made by the Catholiques to succour His Majestie, wherefore another meane is excogitated;

The officious proctors who were fellow-labourers in inhancing this Peace, are known to be such as lent thousands of pounds to the Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> since these tumults, who are thought, to hazard their Religion to secure their moneyes! How such kinde of CREATVRES have crept into our <hi>Councell</hi> and <hi>Committees,</hi> the world hath admired. Some <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guses</hi> have observed, that matters of secrecie, which concerned the King, if they trench'd on <hi>Ormond,</hi> were revealed; other secrecie which concerned <hi>Ormond,</hi> though they touched Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, King and Countrey, were kept with asmuch priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, as the things contained in the <hi>booke of the seaven seales;</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Our Committee, to excuse themselves, impose the fault on the Marques, affirming, that whensoever they demanded any of those first promised conditions,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sup. n.</hi> 8.</note> hee alwayes thwarted their demand by some contrary proposition: for example, when they demanded the free exercise of their Religion, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own overture in publique assemblie, hee answered; you shall indeed, but not in Churches. When they demanded the <hi>repeale of the penall laves made against the Catholiques;</hi> hee returned this frivolous answer, that such <hi>repeale</hi> could not be, granted, without the repeale of the penall lawes made against the Protestants also; whereby they were obliged to heare or reade the Booke of Common Prayer in Churches, whereunto hee would not condescend; tacitly intimating thereby, that he resolved in oportune time to deprive us of our Churches. If such sly evasions were reply-worthy, it might be asked, what connexion is there betweene the penall lawes made against the Catholiques and those made against the Protestants, that the one can not be repealed without the other? are not the lawes,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:154413:14"/>the branches and members thereof distinct? If there were no Churches <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> would the Protestants incurre the penalties of the law, if (in that case) they reade not the booke of Common Prayer in Churches? or if their devotion be so siry, as they will needs reade their prophane service in Churches; why build they not Churches for themselves? or why might not a kitchin, or stable serve them for a Church, and a tub for a pulpit, as it serves their zealous brethren in England, but needs they must prey on the Catholique Churches? why doe they not renounce the Popish Churches and Church-livings, as they renounce the Popish doctrine and regular discipline? whence sprung this late hatch'd zeale in those Sect-masters, who in one yeare demolished or prophaned ten thousand Churches, monasteries and Sancturies? some are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (but I'le suspend my judgement) that such luke-warme Brethren should be assigned for the exercise of their devotion, such Churches as they may lay hold on in the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> or in <hi>Concavo Lunae,</hi> where they may be separated from the Tents of <hi>Israel,</hi> from the botch of Poperie, to speake in their dialect. That moves me to laughter, to see the fervour of the brethren of <hi>Dublin</hi> endevouring to preserve the use and exercise of the Booke of Common Prayer, when as all <hi>Scotland,</hi> and all the Parliamentaries of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> have, even by the

Now when all the Heretiques of these three Ilands have reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that <hi>Babill,</hi> must the Catholiques of <hi>Ireland</hi> preserve it, and become <hi>Vltores Baal?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. But I returne from this small digression: whether shall wee applaude the Marques, for his zeale in defence of his abortive Sect, or reprehend our Committee for pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimitie in defence of the Catholique faith? whether shall wee accuse the Marques for recoiling from his solemne promise; or our Agents for transcending their Commission? the Marques for transgressing his Masters commands, or our Agents for contemning them? <hi>Lapis offensionis, Glamorgans</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, were thought to have beene removed, and that gave
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:154413:14"/>occasion of <hi>Ormonds</hi> retrocession. But if neither honour to God, advance to Religion, securitie to Soveraigne, libertie to subject did result from this Peace? if neither necessitie on our part, nor utilitie on the Kings part, no obligation of Law, did enforce this Peace, what reasonable motive could there be to induce our Agents to condescend thereunto?

Yea the Supreme Councell it selfe,
<note place="margin">7. Reason.</note> as appeareth by their letters unto the Lord <hi>Nuncius,</hi> dated at <hi>Limmericke,</hi> the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> manifested their resolution to publish <hi>Ormonds</hi> peace,
<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell would not print or publish <hi>Glamer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions.</note> which they shortly expected, and not to publish <hi>Glamorgans;</hi> and this was cloaked with a specious pretext, that such suppression of <hi>Glamorgans</hi> peace was <hi>in maius Catholicae Religionis bonum;</hi> whereas it is well knowne, they suppressed the same, because the Marques of <hi>Ormond</hi> did resolve to set forth a publike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation in print against them and that Peace, in case they did publish the same. Neither had <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Peace beene either printed or published to this day, had not the Clergie by their five Propositions sent unto the Councell from <hi>VVaterford</hi> to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> enforced them thereunto. And though they were thereupon printed (to decline the just complaints and exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people) yet was the publication of them forthwith suppressed, as much as in them lay.
<note place="margin">8. Reason. Witnesses present are appealed unto.</note> The Lord <hi>Digby</hi> (among others) was an eye-witnesse of the signing and sealing of these Articles of Peace; and he was so farre from acknowledging, that by those <hi>further Concessions</hi> mentioned in this second branch of the Articles, either of both parties (the Marques or our Committee) intended <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Articles, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards going into <hi>France,</hi> he publiquely declared upon his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that the <hi>Irish</hi> were pleased to renounce the benefit of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgans</hi> Peace, which he would never presume to doe, were he not certaine of our Committees resolution, when they signed and sealed the Peace. And least this Noble witnesse should be suspected, we pray the Reader to satisfie his owne conscience in this particular, by conferring upon opportunity with <hi>Sir Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Eustace, Doctor Fennell,</hi> the Marques <hi>Clanrichard,</hi> the Lord <hi>Taffe, Monsieur du Molin, Daniell O Neale,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comman,

True it is, that after all things were accomplished, they moved the Marques there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, who flatly told them he never meaned to allow or approve by those words <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Articles: notwithstanding all which, our Councell, Committees and Agents delude the kingdome, that <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Articles are included in this Peace.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Yea, but <hi>there is a power</hi> (say our Committees) <hi>left in the late Supreme Councell to convocate a generall Assembly and to cause the kingdome to resume armes in case the bill to be presented to the Parliament for confirmation of Glamorgans Articles,</hi>

By what right may wee resume armes against him or any other for not consenting to the confirmation of <hi>Glamorgans</hi> Articles by Parliament, seeing neither he, nor any for him, was ever obliged thereunto? How doe those men thinke, they shall be <hi>then</hi> able to take Armes against him or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of other; <hi>when</hi> their Armies, Command, and Government are in their enemies obedience, and his power thereby much augmented, seing that they themselves confesse, they are not able <hi>now</hi> to take armes against him, when Armies, Command, and Government are in their owne hands, and their power stronger than ever, its like to be. Wee should then indeed be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:154413:16"/>Rebells, who were ever good Subject before, and take Armes against that Peace, which we our selves under hand and seale concluded.</p>

Nay though they were come timely unto the hands of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, yet could they availe us nothing, seeing nothing is to passe in that Parliament, but what is included in these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as appeareth by the second Article of this Peace. And what greater honour could his Excellency get from King and Parliament, than to have concluded a peace (and that without blowes) more advantagious for the new deformed Church, than either King or Parliament of themselves could doe; or what greater dishonour could the Catholique Confederats get among forrain Princes and Prelats, than to have concluded a Peace with a Protestant or Puritan subject on more base condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than they might conclude with a Catholique subject of the greatest extraction in <hi>England,</hi> authorized by His Majestie in the greatest trust and confidence. Yea, to accept of a worse peace from the subjest, than they might have had from their Prince. This was to hazard the Prince and to ingratiat the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with the Prince his enemies.</p>
               <p n="17">17. I am persuaded, if we had so much assisted the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and given them as large contributions, as wee have done to <hi>Ormond,</hi> we should obtaine better conditions from them, if wee held it not disloyaltie to treat with such Rebells. Yet suppose wee were driven to resume armes, would it not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:154413:17"/>presently follow, that we should be first deprived of what pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie favours are granted by these Articles, then indited, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions taken on gentlemens lands; afterward all the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie that could befall one nation, should be heaped on us. And being thus strip'd from our Armes, Ammunition, Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, Government and Command, wee should be left deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and as Lambs exposed to the jawes of those wolves, who have vowed the destruction of us and our Religion. In vaine should wee then expect succours from forrain Catholique Princes or Prelats, who having observed our tergiversation in the cause of God by yeelding to a Peace no way answerable to our first resolutions, would let us sinke in our owne miserie without their aide or Armes; and proclaime unto the world (as already some have done) <hi>one Butler hath intexicated all the Confederate Catholiques in Ireland.</hi> And this is all the benefit we should gaine by this desperate resumption of armes. Certes were the contrivers of this Peace to purchase a peece of land for themselves and their heires, they had been more carefull to provide and perfect sure and valide instruments to secure such lands, than they have beene to provide and perfect sure and valid instruments for the securing of Gods Church and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed Nation.

Wheresore by this second Article of the Peace two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable injuries have been offered unto the Parliaments of this kingdome, and vnto the liberties of the whole nation: the one is, the not repealing, or (at least) <hi>suspension of Poynings</hi> act; the other is, the giving of such exorbitant power unto any Chiefe Governour, (a subject) to <hi>propound,</hi> and in propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>conclude</hi> by Parliament what Act he thinke sit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, so as it carry any shew of advancement of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties service, or Peace of the kingdome.
<note place="margin">10. Hen. 7. c. 4. pag. 55.56. Irish Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts.</note> The substance of <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings Act</hi> is, <hi>that no Parliament</hi> be held in <hi>Ireland, but at such season, as the Kings Lieutenant and Conunsaile there first doe certifie the king under the great Seale of that land the causes and Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and all such Acts as them seemeth should passe in the same Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and such causes, considerations and Acts affirmed by the king and His Counsaile to be good &amp; expedient for that land, and His licence thereupon, as well in affirmation of the said Causes and Acts, as to summon the said Parliament under His great Seale of England had and obtained; that done a Parliament to be had and holden after the forme and effect afore rehearsed, &amp;c.</hi> By this Act every meane judgment may observe, that there is neither libertie, power or authoritie left in any the Parliaments of <hi>Ireland:</hi> not libertie, because they can treate of nothing, but what is determined and limitted unto them by the Kings <hi>Lieutenant and Councell</hi> in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by the King himselfe and his <hi>Councell</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> not power or authoritie; because, in very deed, its not our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, but our King himselfe, his Lieutenant, and both the Councells, which conclude (as they determine) all Acts past in that Parliament. So as our Parliaments, while this Act hath force, have onely the name and title of a Parliament, but in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is no true Parliament; and the Acts so past in that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be rather called Acts of State of the privie Councell of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> than Acts of Parliament of the whole kingdome of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4.
<note place="margin">Why <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> act at first past.</note> The reason wherefore <hi>Ireland</hi> yeelded unto this Act in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, was (as I am informed by the learned in the lawes of this kingdome) that some Chiefe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors here ruling for our Kings, assumed unto themselves too great power, and endevoured to passe in Parliament Acts
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:154413:21"/>conducing to their owne ends and interests, but burdensome to the whole kingdome; which caused the subject to shroud himselfe under the wings of his Prince, who might moderate the excesses of such chiefe Governors. Now by this second Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Peace, that exorbitancie of chiefe Governors, which the kingdome, then endevoured to prevent by condescending to <hi>Poynings</hi> act, is not onely countenanced, but by article in the whole kingdomes name established, and withall <hi>Poynings</hi> act (which in these dayes of heresie is a more heavy grievance, than the other) is continued in its full force and vigour: <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> (as chiefe Governour is licenced (yea, in a manner au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized) to <hi>propound</hi> and <hi>conclude</hi> what he please in our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; &amp; <hi>Poynings</hi> act observed; because what Bills must passe in Parliament must be <hi>transmitted into England, according the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all forme.</hi> This maketh strongly for the justification of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies decree of perjurie against such, as herein violated that branch of the oath of Association obliging them to <hi>maintaine &amp; defend the priviledges, &amp; iust rights of the Parliaments of Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Our learned Lawyers (I meane such, as elaborated this Peace) tell us, it was alwayes doubted, whether the <hi>repeale of Poynings</hi> Act would prove profitable or prejudiciall to the Couuntrey. And wee tell them, its one thing to speake of the <hi>repeale</hi> of <hi>Poynings</hi> act, and another thing to speake of the <hi>sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension</hi> thereof for the present time: the first was absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by us in our declaration set forth in the yeare 1642. the later absolutely demanded, as well in our grievances presented to His Majestie 17. <hi>March,</hi> 1642. as in our second proposition, where the whole kingdome declared that the present <hi>suspension</hi> of <hi>Poynings</hi> act conduced to the <hi>speedy settlement of the affaires of the kingdome.</hi> I could wish our Committees did herein follow their Commission;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3.</note> and <hi>not to be more wise then behoveth, but to be wise to sobrietie:</hi> Our forefathers (28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 4. and 11. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethae</hi>) held the <hi>suspension of Poynings act very necessarie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the kingdome:</hi> I know not of any infused science our Committees have had in this particular, more than the whole kingdome then and now. Our Soveraigne held it a grace and favour to grant it us, and we to receive it from him. Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to comply with one subject, reject the Kings graces,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:154413:21"/>and transgresse the commission given them by the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Multum erigimini filij Levi.</hi> It is thought,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 16, 7,</note> they (by vertue of the Kings letter 27. <hi>February</hi> 1644. whereby he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the suspension of <hi>Poynings</hi> act) might passe an act in the present dismembred Parliament at <hi>Dublin,</hi> that in the future Parliament, <hi>Poynings</hi> act should be suspended; and so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay prevented, which our Committee pretend they feared.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Is there any man, that desires the securitie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Religion, and libertie of his Countrey, that will not confidently affirme, that the absolute <hi>repeale</hi> of that act in these times of heresie is most necessarie, aswell for the Catholiques of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as for the whole kingdome? Put the case, wee were now (as indeed we are, and ought to be) of a resolution to establish and secure the Catholique faith against those enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Wolves who endeavour to abolish both Religion and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty; is it possible that wee shall be ever able to compasse the same, while <hi>Poynings</hi> act hath force or vigour; when as by that act, wee must first have the consent of the Lieutenant and Councell of <hi>Ireland</hi> (who have sworne to destroy the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion) and after the consent of the King and Councell in <hi>England</hi> (who endeavour to maintaine the Protestant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession) before any thing can be enacted or established by Act of Parliament in this kingdome, for establishing or securing the same Catholique Religion. Whereas if <hi>Poynings</hi> act were repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and a free Parliament, sutable to the nature of true Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and liberties of a free Nation, were granted unto us; we should not only be enabled to passe Acts in the name of the whole kingdome to secure our Religion, but also to assist our Soveraigne, and to curb the insolencie of those rebellious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, who labour to destroy both.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I have ever admired how the acts of 2. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

By conference with a learned Lawyer (one well seene in these affayres) and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some histories, I found indeed that such acts past in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by faction, fraud, and violence. 2. <hi>Elizabethae,</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Dublin</hi> on <hi>May</hi>-eve, was proroged untill the next
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:154413:22"/>day after <hi>May</hi>-day, and accordingly the members of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament advertised not to appeare untill then; interim the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique partie (though few in number, but powerfull by the Deputie, who was of their Sect and faction) privately Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon all such, as by faction, fraude, or delusorie promise, they could draw on their side, to appeare on <hi>May</hi>-day in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the Parliament-house, they corrupt the Speaker, who was <hi>Mr. Stanihurst</hi> of <hi>Corduffe,</hi> then Recorder of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and prepare the bills for the establishing of those penall lawes; which being three times read, they thought to passe as an act of Parliament. The Catholique and uncorrupt members ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice thereof throng in all hast to the Parliament: among them <hi>Sir Edmund Butler</hi> drawing his sword questioned with zeale and magnanimitie such sinister and damnable practises; and so great tumults were raised, as the Deputie himselfe was forced to interpose his authoritie, which could little availe, had he not solemnely &amp; publiquely sworne, BY THE CROWNE OF ENGLAND, that no such acts should ever passe, or be admitted as an act of Parliament in this kingdome: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, during the following yeares of the raigne of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> (which were upwards of fortie two yeares) and untill the tenth yeare of king <hi>Iames,</hi> these supposed penall lawes lay dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and were never put in execution, which by the Law of <hi>prescription,</hi> was a sufficient nullitie and antiquation of such Acts, if before (by hooke or crooke, fraud or violence) they were of any force or effect. By that time those witnesses and members of the Parliament, who were present at these trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous proceedings being dead, the Persecutors of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Religion make use of those illegall, lawlesse lawes, and endeavour to put them in execution. The kingdome by their Agents in <hi>England</hi> informe His Majestie of such corrupt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and when the king urged them to receive for a law, those Acts of Queene <hi>Elizabeth, Sir Christopher Nugent</hi> knight, one of our Agents, told His Majestie, that though such lawes past in <hi>England,</hi> yet they never past in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but in the frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent manner above mentioned. Neither did the Queene her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe ever urge the same upon the <hi>Irish.</hi>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154413:26"/>Catholiques have gained by their labours, meanes, armes, and blood, is notable injustice: for if the reward in such distributions be proportioned to the merit; Surely there will be no place left for heretiques to governe or possesse such forts, Cities, &amp;c. as the Catholiques recovered, seeing they herein had no part or portion of any merit: and if I may speake the truth, according the allegiance I owe to truth, its neither se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to Religion, King, or Countrey, that such Proselyts pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse or governe our Forts, Cityes &amp;c. whose daily revolt in <hi>England,</hi> and universall desection in <hi>Ireland</hi> in the progresse of this warre giveth a well-grounded argument of their disloyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

Why its here said His Majestie WILL LEAVE, and not (DOTH LEAVE) I conceive not; unlesse it be to discover the wyles of the penners of this Article, who would drive the Confederate Catholiques to a new supplication, and His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie to a new answer, that he DOTH <hi>ex nunc</hi> LEAVE this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to both houses of Parliament in <hi>Ireland.</hi> I observe, that the Catholique Confederates here demanded not onely a DECLGRATION <hi>of both houses,</hi> but also <hi>an act of</hi> PARLIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT; the former is (after a manner) promised in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; the later past by and omitted.

               <p n="21">21. The Confederate Catholiques caused diligent search to be made in the foresaid Treasurie for the said Statuts, but they spent their labour in vaine.

But titles betweene partie and partie, growne after these patents granted, are to be left to the ordinarie Course of law.</hi> Our Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees by condescending to this article have gone beyond their Commission expressed in our first Remonstrance anno 1642. wherein the kingdome desired, <hi>that all plantations made since</hi> 1610. might <hi>be avoided by Parliament, &amp;c. and their possessions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to them and their heires, from whom the same was taken.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of <hi>avoiding such plantations,</hi> our Committees have given way, not onely that they should remaine, but also (by consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to this article) have given that power unto the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell-Table, which by law they never had, nor could have. Its an injustice insupportable, in a matter so generall, and of such high Concernement, as is the Subjects ancient possession and inheritance, to deprive him of his birth-right, that is to say, of the Common-law; So as if <hi>offices</hi> taken upon, and Patents given of, his lands appeare to be defective, forged, erroneous, or surreptitious, hee is denyed all manner of redresse either by travers, reversement, or otherwise in any Court of Iudicature in the kingdome: at the Councell-boord, lesse redresse may be expected, as well because most of the Councell are both Iudges and parties, as having much plantation land in their possession; as also because they have resolved to make it a matter of State, therfore (be it right or be it wrong) they shall never be righted. How farre this may agree with <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> (which our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes have vowed to maintaine, I leave to the discussion of our learned Lawyers.

               </head>
               <p n="27">27. THis article answereth to our fixteenth proposition, Proposition, where wee demanded that an <hi>act of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion should be passed to extend to all Catholique Subiects.</hi> This Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle <hi>extends to all His Maiesties Subiects and their adherents,</hi> and under collour of the name of Subjects, this <hi>act</hi> of oblivion is extended (without any commission or power from His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie) to all the <hi>Scots</hi> and Parliamentarie Rebells in these three kingdomes. To grant an <hi>act of oblivion</hi> to the Catholiques, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:154413:32"/>swore to defend His Majesties Crowne and dignitie, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commission of the Lord Lieutenant, in qualitie of Lord Lieutenant, served not the turne; but a new and speciall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission must necessarily be sought for from His Majestie. But to grant an <hi>act of oblivion</hi> to all the Parliamentarie Rebells, <hi>Scots, English, Connactians, Momonians. &amp;c.</hi> who tooke the <hi>Oath of Covenant</hi> to destroy the king, His Crowne and dignitie, the Lord Marques supposeth such speciall Commission to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse. It may seeme a strange Paradox that the <hi>Irish,</hi> whose assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance His Majestie earnestly desireth against the Rebellious Parliamentaries &amp; <hi>Scots;</hi> must be forced to looke for pardon for the offence they never committed; and those Rebells, against whom His Majestie invites the <hi>Irish</hi> to fight, are admitted to grace and favour with impunitie and without any Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Shall Noble <hi>Antrym</hi> and all those loyall <hi>Irish,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Scotland</hi> for His Majestie, be brought under the same rod, their case in <hi>Scotland</hi> being the same with that of the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Catholiques in <hi>Ireland?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28. In all these Articles there is not one article that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the <hi>Scots</hi> or other Parliamentaries (in case they accept the peace) to render unto His Majestie or His Lieutenant the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of any the Cities, or Forts they have, or to give up the Command of their Armies, &amp;c. which is very remarkable, &amp; can in no sort stand with securitie of Religion, King, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. In the Cities and Forts which they possesse they will still stand as Scouts to entertaine the comming of their Brethren the Parliamentaries of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in the field they will be still readie to joyne with the Kings sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Hence wee may conjecture, why, when in our seventh additionall proposition we demanded that the <hi>Scots,</hi> and such as tooke the <hi>Oath of Covenant</hi> might be proclaimed Traitors; and that such <hi>Counties or Corporations,</hi> as <hi>submitted not to the Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> might not be admitted to make any returne to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) wee were answered by the Marques that hee had no Commission to proclaime them Traitors, nor to prosecute them by warre; and that to debarre such rebellious <hi>Townes,</hi> or <hi>Corporations</hi> from the Parliament, <hi>was inconsistent with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a free Parliament.</hi> Whereunto it might be replyed that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:154413:32"/>the Lord Lieutenant had more Commission to proclaime them Traitors, than he had to receive them into protection, or to quit them by <hi>act of Oblivion;</hi> they being all proclaimed Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in <hi>England</hi> by the Kings Majestie. But if the Parliament which is to be in <hi>Ireland</hi> must be therfore said to be no <hi>free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> because proclaimed Parliamentarie Rebells shall not be admitted thereunto, how much more ought all the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in <hi>England,</hi> that have been since, the dayes of heresie, &amp; especially the present dismembred Parliament in <hi>Dublin,</hi> be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stly styled no <hi>free or lawfull Parliaments,</hi> seeing from thence, they have still excluded His Majesties loyall Catholique Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p n="29">29. When likewise in our eight additionall proposition we justly demanded that the <hi>estates of such as adhered to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be forfeited, and in the interim their lands and possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, might remaine in their hands, wherein they were at that present:</hi> this sleight answer is given <hi>(such consideration shall be had of this proposition; as shall be fit.)</hi> And this <hi>sit consideration</hi> was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; than to invite and scot-free to receive them into pardon, and grace, as in this and the 25. Article of Peace plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. What else may a faithfull Subject here suspect, but a disloyall Combination betweene the partie aforesaid?</p>
               <p n="30">30. Wee further observe, that the act of oblivion hath its Commencement from the 23. of october, 1641. So as all crimes committed on the 22. of October (when the Castle of <hi>Dublin</hi> was to be surprized) may be questioned notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>act of oblivion:</hi> moreover, a <hi>Proviso</hi> is added in the same <hi>act of oblivion,</hi> that certaine <hi>barbarous and unhuman crimes</hi> are reserved to be punished by the <hi>Lord Lieutenant</hi> and the twelve <hi>Persons selected by him, or any five of them;</hi> which may ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the heads of the best Gentlemen in the kingdome; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those, who by armes and valour shewed themselves most zealous in advancing the Catholique cause, as the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls of <hi>Leinster, Vlster, Sir Phelim O Neale,</hi> and those other honest Catholiques, who were against the faction. If it be answered, that this <hi>Proviso</hi> was added to give satisfaction to our 17, Proposition; we reply, that we desired the <hi>Parliament should question such barbarous and unhuman crimes,</hi> and not any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:154413:33"/>private Persons selected to determine what matters they list by an arbitrary power. But as this <hi>Proviso</hi> doth aime at the lives and estates of some particulars; so doth the whole act at the lives, and estates of all the Confederats; seeing the <hi>act of obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion</hi> is not to be granted untill, and by the Parliament, which being uncertaine, this <hi>act of oblivion</hi> is also uncertaine. Interim what security have the Catholiques of their lives and estates? Here againe, I marvaile our Committee did not endeavour to have this act forthwith past in the present Parliament, for the Catholiques present securitie.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154413:36"/>obliged to returne bookes and Extracts aswell of these fourth parts, as of Excises and other things? and by that meanes they discover unto the Heretiques, how they themselves may taxe, levy and take up those fourth parts, and force the Catholique Gentlemen to Contribute (against their conscience) the same meanes to maintaine Heresie, which (with integrity of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) they freely contributed to maintaine Religion.

                  <p n="41">41. In the foresaid 25. Article, or elsewhere in the rest of the Articles of this Peace, I find not that our foresaid twelve Noble Catholique personages are honoured, so much as with the title of <hi>Commissioners;</hi> and if their title must be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the office by those articles given them, I know no other title can be given them, than the title of TOL-GATHERERS for the Puritans and Parliamentaries of <hi>Dublin;</hi> a title no waies beseeming men of their qualitie, who have been Chiefe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators of the Catholique affaires in <hi>Ireland</hi> since these warrs, and the title the more contemptible that they are authorized to taxe and lay applotments on their fellow Confederate Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques onely, and on their lands, and not on the Protestants, or other Parliamentaties: in so much as if the fugitire Heretiques,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:154413:38"/>who parted from our Quarters and sided with the Parliament did returne upon this Peace to our Quarters, they have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to taxe or, applot any thing upon them or their lands, so as they must be free from all impositions &amp; Contributions, but the poore Catholique heavily loaden. Whether the foresaid <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners of Oyer and Terminer,</hi> shall be Catholiques or hereticks is not determined by any of those articles. It was the part of our intrusted Committee of the treatie to provide, that they should be named expressely Catholiques, least otherwise the lives and estates of many the Confederate Catholiques might be hazarded, such Commissioners having power over their lives and lands. I admired wherefore these <hi>Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer</hi> should be authorized by Commission under the great Seale, and that those twelve noble personages (whose power might seeme to transcend theirs) were onely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed <hi>by act of state.</hi> In conference with a learned Lawyer my admiration quickely ceased, who gave me a full resolution of what before I rightly suspected, to wit, that those of <hi>Dublin</hi> dared not authorize by Commission under the broad Seale those twelve noble Personages to execute such particulars, as above are mentioned in the five and twentieth article, foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thereby they might become Accessories of treason, or felony at least, seeing that such as without the generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the kingdome doe make such applotments and levies, and doe put the same in execution by cessing of horse and foote are guiltie of treason by the <hi>Irish</hi> Satute of 18. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 3. or of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony for Goynee, &amp; Liverie by the Statuts of 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10. <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 18. Wherefore the State of <hi>Dublin</hi> though in the begining that of article they AVTHORIZE those twelve persons <hi>to the ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars,</hi> yet when they descend to the same <hi>particulars</hi> they dared not use the word AVTHORIZE, but the word PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIT, saying the <hi>Persons to be authorized, as</hi> aforesaid, are PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MITTED) WITHOVT INTERRYPTION <hi>to applot, raise &amp; levy meaues, &amp;c.</hi> as above. Yet when they come to the matter of obliging the foresaid twelve noble personages to make <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Books abstracts, duplicats, &amp;c. of all such money as shall be applotted &amp;c.</hi> to the end a <hi>perfect account may be given</hi> to our adver<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

They ought to be mindfull of the <hi>Ship-money</hi> declared unlawfull by the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> though ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotted immediately by His Majestie himselfe for the present necessitie of the kingdome: how much more would any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plotments, taxes, levyes, or impositions laid on the kingdome by any act of state from <hi>Dublin</hi> be so judged and condemned as unlawfull, and contrarie to the ancient fundamentall lawes, which by oath the foresaid twelve Noble Persons are tyed to maintaine and defend?</p>
                  <p n="42">42.
<note place="margin">The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners power.</note> The power given the Commissioners of Oyer &amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miner extends not to <hi>riot or treason,</hi> which may encourage as well the <hi>Ecclestasticks,</hi> as the <hi>Seculars</hi> of the adverse partie, to invade by force and violence or other sinister practises the <hi>Churches and Church-livings, Tithes, lands and other possessions</hi> belonging to our Clergie and Seculars, wherein undoubtedly the adverse partie will have great animositie, when he seeth by these articles no act, or ordinance agreed upon to debarre him from such a resolution. Neither doth the power of the foresaid Commissioners extend to <hi>heare or determine titles of lands, &amp;c.</hi> which giveth way to all <hi>Eschetors, Feodaries,</hi> and other officers of the Court of <hi>wards and the Excheaquer</hi> to swarme into our Quarters, there (by hooke or crooke, or other by wayes) (to take offices, and induisitions upon our gentlemens lands, and to returne them to the foresaid Courts, and upon the first op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to put them in execution; the Councell-Table also will make use of this limitation to pursue the <hi>new State af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of plantations.</hi> In civill causes the foresaid <hi>Commissioners</hi> power extends not to upwards often pounds; where then shall the Confederate Catholiques, either for debts due unto them, or trespasses done unto them (for example by invading Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:154413:39"/>or others) above the value often pounds right themselves? In the Corporations within the Confederate Catholiques quarters, we may not be righted, unlesse the debters and tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passers be caught within their liberties; because the power and Iurisdiction of such Corporations extends no further then their liberties. So as if a Protestant Bishop or Minister, (and so of others) can once get footing in our Churches; Sanctuaries, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiasticall possessions and livings, he is like to stay there long enough before he can be ejected either by suite or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, by any power given to the Confederate Catholiques in these articles. In case one of the Confederate Catholiques im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded by another in any the Corporations aforesaid would willingly reverse a judgement there given against him by writ of error, or otherwise, or in case he desired to remove the cause by injunction into the Chancerie, or by <hi>habeas Corpus</hi> unto any other superiour Court, where may he have recourse for justice there, being no other superiour Court within the Catholique Confederats Quarters. The very like and much more may be said of our Courts of Admiraltie, revenue, and other Courts, the further discussion whereof we leave unto honest Lawyers. I am of opinion that this 27. article by which the Catholique Confederates may <hi>neither be sued nor sue</hi> with such restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and limitations of power, doth not so much favour the Catholiques, as it protecteth their adversaries to attempt all mischiefes. The erecting of our Iudicatures after the beginning of these Commotions, was as thornes in the sides, and pricks in the eyes of our Adversaries knowing that such Iudicatures were a soveraigne antidote to preserve the union betweene the Confederate Catholiques, and to dissipate all clamours that might arise through the defect of administration of justice. Our armyes in the field were not so terrible unto them, as the constitution of such Iudicatures, wherefore our adversaries have gained as great a conquest against the Confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques by demolishing this Iudicature, as they gained by transferring unto themselves the command of our Armies, the government of Cities, Forts, and receipts of the revenue.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. Wee have heard, the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was resolved to cause all the decrees or extrajudiciall orders, he gave on paper
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:154413:39"/>petitions to bee approved by Act of Parliament, not onely for the justification of his owne actions, but also because hee would manifest unto the world his care to preserve Iustice unto the subject. Had our Committee of treatie, the same courage the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> had, (as they had a better cause) they would never be so ptodigall of their owne honour, nor so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negligent of those subjects (in number many hundreds) who had sutes in the <hi>Iudicature,</hi> and other Courts instituted by the Confederate Catholiques, whereof as yet many remaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided; as to yeeld to any peace, unlesse first it were agreed upon, that what sentence soever they gave betweene partie and partie, &amp;c, the same should be confirmed by Parliament or otherwise so ratified in <hi>Dublin,</hi> as they should never be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to reversall through defect of power or jurisdiction on the part of the Confederats; and that those causes, that as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend in the Court of Iudicature, should be finally conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the same Court, or upon the peace, proceeded and determined in <hi>Dublin.</hi> to the end the Subject might have no cause of complaint, and that the course of Iustice might have its full currant, even in the heate of warre. While the substance and the essentialls belonging to the law are obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the omission of certaine formalities in these disordered times may be well excused, and consequently the sentences and decrees given in our Iudicatures ought still to remaine in their full fotce, neither ought so many thousand Subjects as have impleaded or been impleaded in the said Iudicatures be forced to commence their sutes againe in any other Court which pretends to derive its power immediately from His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie. <hi>Et sollicitabant corda virorum Israel.</hi>

               </head>
               <p n="46">46. AS by the 25. Article the government in generall of the Confederate Catholiques is changed; so by this 28. Article <hi>the Command, Rule, and Government of their Cities, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons, Forts, &amp;c.</hi> in particular is taken out of their hands. The Confederates <hi>doe continue</hi> (saith the Article) <hi>the possession of such His Maiesties Cities, Garisons, Forts, and Castles, which are within their now Quarters, untill settlement by Parliament. But to be commanded</hi> (marke it well, I pray you) <hi>ruled and governed</hi> in chiefe by such as His Maiestie, or his chiefe Governor, or <hi>Governors shall appoint.</hi> Thus farre without any dependencie of, or relation to <hi>the advise or consent of any the twelve Persons</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove chosen. Here commeth to be noted first, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques have onely the naked possession of the Cities, &amp;c. they preserved or recovered from the Enemie, for the Kings use, wherein they are like to have no more power or libertie (if heretike subjects be Commanders <hi>in Chiefe</hi>) than slaves have in Gallies: neither had this naked possession it selfe beene left them, by their Adversaries, could they otherwise have taken it away from them by force. 2. That possession remaines in the Catholiques hands till settlement, when they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be removed, if the Protestant <hi>Chiefe Governour shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound to both houses that such</hi> removall conduceth to the <hi>advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kings service, and Peace of the kingdome;</hi> for this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer is left him by the second article of this Peace, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Governour will propound (wee may be sure) that the preservation of the Protestants, and suppression of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques is necessarie for the advancement of His Majesties ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and such a Proposition doth not trench on any thing
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154413:41"/>concluded in these Articles in the behalfe of the Catholiques. 3. Such inferiour Governours must <hi>be Governours in Chiefe</hi> in our Cities, &amp;c. contrarie to the Charters and priviledges granted by His Majesties Royall progenitors to such Cities, &amp;c. 4. Suppose then, his Excellencie (according to this article) were (the Peace being accepted) to put in a <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in Chiefe into Duncanon</hi> (the like discourse you may make of all other Forts, &amp;c. in the Confederate Catholiques Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) what can hinder him to place in that fort (of so great importance) Lientenant <hi>Esmond,</hi> or any other heretique Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, that formerly kept the same from King and Countrey for the use of the Parliament? the Catholiques have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suspect such kinde of practises, seeing they see those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Rebells entertained in <hi>Dublin,</hi> as faithfull subjects, who swore the oath of Covenant, and betrayed that Fort to the Parliament. This being done aswell in that Fort, as in the rest of the Forts, Cities, or Garisons in the Catholique Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Quarters, strong Garisons of Horse and Foote, assuredly will be brought in, and then the Magistrats and Inhabitants brought under the yoake; afterwards the <hi>Priests of Belial</hi> with their <hi>yoke-fellowes,</hi> and brats, throng in, and are, without blowes put into quiet possession of our Churches and Church-livings by these new Governors in Chiefe, against which there is no barre in these Articles of Peace. I could wish our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee did remember that saying of the Gospell;
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 11.21.</note>
                  <hi>when the strong armed keepeth his possession, those things are in Peace which he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth, but if a stronger than he come upon him, and overcome him, he will take away his whole armour whereon he trusted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute his spoiles.</hi> 5. Why was there not a particular <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> made in this article, that Generall <hi>Preston,</hi> Generall <hi>O Neale,</hi> and those other well deserving Catholiques, whom the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate Catholiques made Governours of such Forts and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, should be continued in their Government for securitie of Religion and Countrey? But herein our Committee of treatie have been as provident, as they were in preserving places for our Catholique Commanders in the Armies. Lastly, the treatie Peace is dated 28. <hi>March,</hi> 1646. and the naked possession of such Forts, Cities, &amp;c. only as <hi>then</hi> were in the Catholique Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:154413:42"/>is left them: for the Article saith (within their NOW Quarters) so as the possession of <hi>Roscoman, Bunratty,</hi> and all other Forts gayned by the Catholiques since the foresaid 28. day of <hi>March,</hi> and hereafter to be gained by this sociall warre must be given to our Adversaries, and peradventure to the <hi>Scots</hi> themselves; whereby all our future war will prove totally to the advantage of the Protestants and all other Sects, and to the disadvantage of the Catholiques; and yet the charge must lye entirely on the Catholiques.</p>
               <p n="47">47. <hi>The Command, rule, and government</hi> being transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Chiefe Governour, and by him unto the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in Chiefe, whom he alone is to appoint independent of any by the first branch of this Article, he is by the second branch, <hi>to issue Commissions,</hi> and appoint such persons as shall be named by His Majesties Chiefe Governour for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the CONSENT and ADVISE of any five of the foresaid twelve persons; for the EXECVTING of such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, rule, or government: so as both the Command, the appointment and nomination of Commanders, and the giving of Commands unto such Commanders or Governors, as the Chiefe Governour shall thinke fit, is wholly and independent in him alone, wherefore as he may appoint, what tyrant, or heretique he please to governe the Forts and Garisons in the Confederate Catholiques Quarters, so may he give them what Commands he please, even to the destruction of Religion: And as there is no obligation on the Chiefe Governour to comply with any five of the foresaid twelve, in appointing or giving Commands to such Governours in Chiefe, so is there no punishment inflicted by this Article on the Governours in Chiefe in case they EXECVTE such Commands contrarie to the advise and consent aforesaid, so as there is no securitie for Religion, King, and Countrey. If the Chiefe Governour himselfe neglect to aske the advise or consent of any five of the foresaid twelve to the EXECVTION of any Commands hee may give to such inferiour Governor or Governors in Chiefe, and refusing their consent would doe the contrarie, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is provided for the distressed Catholique? It is true that as the present Lord Lieutenant hath induced five of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:154413:42"/>of Threatie, to condescend unto this unluckie Peace, so may hee and his successours induce them to consent to the EXECVTION of what Commands hee please: and if all faile the (the Command, Government, and possession being in his owne hands hee will force our intrusted partie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent unto such EXECVTION, or (at least) he will disdaine to looke after their <hi>consent.</hi>

<note place="margin">Thren. 1.5.</note> In fine my opinion is <hi>(Salvo semper meliori iudicio)</hi> that by this peace <hi>factus est hostis noster</hi> in <hi>capite;</hi> the heretiques have in effect obtained what they themselves desired in their foure and twenty bloody <hi>Propositions</hi> presented in the name of the <hi>Protestants</hi> to His Majestie against the Catholiques, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the <hi>establishment of Protestancie;</hi> suppression of Poperie; the continuation of the pretended <hi>Dublin</hi> Parliament; the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the government established by the Confederate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, the pessession of our armes and ammunition, the Command of our Armyes, and government of the Cities and Forts in our Quarters; the maintenance of the armyes and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons by Catholiques, to destroy themselves; the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Poynings</hi> act in force, as the Protestants desired in their 16. <hi>Proposition;</hi> the Continuance of all the penall lawes in force against Catholiques, and the extirpation of Catholiques <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, Clergie and Regulars,</hi> and consequently of all Catholiques <hi>percute pastorem, &amp; dispergenturoves.</hi> And when all is done, we have heard our Committee of Treatie confesse, that there is no absolute Peace concluded, but <hi>an union or pacification onely: obstupescite caeli super hoc.</hi> The pretended Protestants desire this union to preserve themselves; and shall Catholiques purchase the same with no lesse price than their owne destruction?
